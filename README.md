# Battlecode 2021 Submission of Baby Ducks

This is the Battlecode 2021 submission of team Baby Ducks (Josh Brunner, Anthony Grebe, Jason Ye, and Wesley Zhang).


### Project Structure

The `src/` directory contains various versions of the bot at different stages of the competition.
- `sprint1` and `sprint2` are the submissions to the first and second sprint tournament.
- `quals` is the submission to the qualifying tournament.
- `finals` is the final submission used in the championship tournament.

The remaining files are used for the client and gradle (which runs matches locally for testing).  Details are available from the main Battlecode website on how to run matches locally.
