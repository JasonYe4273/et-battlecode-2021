<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

If you aren't familiar with Battlecode 2021, you can find the specs <a href="https://2021.battlecode.org/specs/specs.md.html">here</a>. We won't go into detail about the mechanics of the game, and instead talk more about strategy, especially our strategy.

<h2><a name="resources"></a>Units and Resources</h2>

<p>As is usual, the four units this year &mdash; (Muck)<b>r</b>akers, <b>p</b>oliticians, and <b>s</b>landerers &mdash; form an RPS (rock-paper-scissors) triangle: politians beat rakers, which beat slanderers, which beat politicians.  So, it is hard to win using only one type of unit, and the most effective strategies will build a combination of all three units &mdash; muckrakers to destroy enemy slanderers, slanderers to produce income to finance your army, and politicians to defend slanderers against enemy muckrakers and attack ECs.</p>

<p>The obvious resource this year is influence. However, there is another very important, very limited resource: unit spawns. Because you cannot build more ECs, and the only way of obtaining more is by capturing either neutral or enemy ECs, unit spawns have a hard cap, and thus are very valuable. One EC will have a hard time beating five enemy ECs even if it has 10 times the influence.</p>

<p>Looking at the units with these resources in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Slanderers</b>, obviously, produce a lot of influence. This was initially exponential, but is now (basically) linear after nerfs, with the influence generated capped at size 949. However, they cost units, in that they don't do anything else until they turn into politicians after 300 turns. Plus, they are very vulnerable to enemy muckrakers, and so require extra units and influence to be invested into protecting them.</li>
  <li><b>Politicians</b> are mostly influence negative, as a tax of 10 is subtracted when they empower, and even more influence is lost if you overkill an enemy unit. The only exception is when you have a buff. Their advantage, then, is entirely in that they are very unit positive. It isn't difficult to kill several enemy units with one politician, and capturing ECs with politicians is the only way to increase your unit spawns.</li>
  <li><b>Muckrakers</b> are a strange case. If one ever exposes a slanderer, it is immediately one of your best units, being both very influence positive and unit positive, even if you don't use the buff. But otherwise, small muckrakers are often unit negative (as they get killed in multiples by enemy politicians), and large muckrakers are often influence negative (as they have 70% the conviction for the same amount of influence).</li>
</ul>

<p>Votes also exist. However, at least at the top of the leaderboard, they weren't very important. Most games ended by annihilation, and almost all of the others had a huge difference in influence and units at the end (usually in the form of just a couple leftover units on one team). I believe exactly one game in the finals did not fit either of those. So, early voting usually just meant wasted influence. You had to have some reasonable voting to win long games where you're up on influence, but didn't need anything too aggressive or fancy.</p>

<h2><a href="strategy"></a>Our Overall Strategy</h2>

<p>Our overall strategy was one focused on generating large amounts of influence with slanderers, and leveraging that to eventually annihilate the opponent.</p>

<h3>Enlightenment Centers</h3>

<p>By default, our ECs build slanderers until we reach various income thresholds. As we build more slanderers, we also make sure to have a certain quota of politicians built to protect them from muckrakers. The only thing that takes precedent over building our income (besides obvious things like not building slanderers if muckrakers are around) is building one politician to attack each neutral EC, as unit spawns, and thus ECs are very important.</p>

<p>If we have enough income, we will start building a mix of politicians and muckrakers of difference sizes in order to attack enemy ECs. The only other times we build muckrakers are if we are low on influence and saving up.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Because we are very dependent on slanderers, a big part of our communication is about enemy muckraker sightings. All of our units will signal any enemy muckrakers seen to nearby units using flags, and this information will be passed on. Slanderers use this information to run away from the nearest enemy muckraker, even beyond sight range; politicians use this information to hunt down enemy muckrakers to better protect our slanderers.</p>

<p>We also use flags to communicate the locations of enemy and neutral ECs, as well as the edges of the map. Unlike enemy muckraker positions, this is communicated only to and from ECs, and not unit-to-unit.</p>

<h3>Politicians</h3>

<p>As both influence and unit spawns are important resources, we decided to take both into account to determine when our politicians empower. We ended up using the metric of <code>100*(kills-2) + (influenceDrained - convictionSpent)</code>, where <code>kills</code> counts the number of enemies killed (counting muckrakers twice and ECs ten times), and <code>influenceDrained</code> counts the influence worth of the conviction affected. Our politicians would empower only if this metric was positive (outside of special cases such as protecting nearby slanderers). This roughly boils down to prioritizing multiple kills, especially ones with muckrakers, but not to the point of killing two tiny muckrakers with one huge politician.</p>

<h3>Pathfinding</h3>


<!-- <p>The theme of the 2021 battlecode competition is a political campaign between two sets of robots trying to win the election at all costs.  To accomplish this, teams try to accumulate political influence, which is stored in the various units and used to purchase new ones.  Unit costs are not fixed -- your team decides how much influence to spend on each unit spawned, and the influence spent determines that unit's conviction (its health), reflecting its loyalty to your team's cause.  This year's competition features only four units:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Enlightenment Centers</b>: These are the headquarters of the political organization.  They are immovable buildings that are present from the beginning of the game, so they can be captured but never created or destroyed.  They generate a small amount of influence passively, and they spawn additional units.  At the beginning of the game, enlightenment centers can be neutral, in which case they take no actions until captured by a player.</li>
  <li><b>Politicians</b>: A politician's conviction can be converted into a rousing speech that functions as an attack that deals damage evenly to all nearby units.  Nearby enlightenment centers (neutral or enemy), as well as rival politicians, can be converted to your cause if the strength of the attack exceeds their conviction, while enemy muckrakers and slanderers are destroyed.  As such, politicians are crucial both for unit-to-unit combat and for attacks on enlightenment centers.</li>
  <li><b>Slanderers</b>: These are the main income-generating units of the game.  A slanderer's lies win over the citizenry, generating income for the Enlightenment Center that spawned it for fifty turns.  (The influence generated is 5% of the slanderer's cost for small-cost slanderers and then plateaus at 2% of their cost, so slanderers that cost about 1000 influence or less provide a very good return on investment.)  After producing this massive influence boost, slanderers are effectively useless for the next 250 turns, but 300 turns after creation they convert into politicians to reinforce your "army."</li>
  <li><b>Muckrakers</b>: Slanderers would be completely overpowered were it not for the investigative journalism of muckrakers.  A muckraker that gets close to an enemy slanderer can expose its lies, instantly destroying the slanderer.  Furthermore, for fifty turns following this exposure, all politicians on the muckraker's team receive a buff to their attack proportional to the value of the exposed slanderer.  This bonus can stack (so if multiple slanderers are exposed within 50 turns, politicians can receive a much larger buff, giving a substantially more powerful attack).  As such, it is imperative to defend slanderers from muckraker attacks, and failing to do so will lose you not only your slanderers but also any battles with enemy politicians and (quite possibly) the game.</li>
</ul><br> -->

<!-- <h2><a name="winning"></a>Winning the Game </h2>
<p>The game can end in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Complete annihilation of all units and capture of all enlightenment centers of one of the two teams results in immediate victory for the other team.</li>
  <li>On each turn, each enlightenment center may bid some of its influence to win over the citizenry.  The enlightenment center with the highest bid spends that amount of influence to win one vote (and the losing team must pay half of its bid and gain nothing in return).  After 1500 turns, the game is declared to be over, and the team with the most votes wins.  (As a consequence, accumulating more than 751 votes is unnecessary and simply wastes influence.)</li>
</ol><br>
<p>In practice, most games conclude via annihilation, but a significant fraction of games (about a quarter) are resolved through the election.  Determining how much to bid on each round without wasting too much influence is an important feature of the game.</p><br> -->

<!-- <h2><a name="vision"></a>Vision and Communication</h2>
<p>Units do not have visibility of the entire map; instead, they can only see things within about 5 tiles of them.  This year, robots do not even know the size and shape of the map unless they have explored enough to find the map's edges.  Additionally, all maps are offset by a large constant in both the x- and y-directions, so a robot's absolute location gives almost no information about its position relative to the map's edges.</p><br>

<p>In order to gain information about the map that they have not personally seen, robots need to communicate with each other.  They do so by holding up a 24-bit color flag, which is stored in the last 32 bits of an <code>int</code>.  Units can read the flags of any nearby robots as well as enlightenment centers, and enlightenment centers can read the flags of any robot.  (While robots can in principle read enemy flags, these typically contain meaningless information without the enemy's source code, which is inaccessible to players.)</p><br>

<p>Our team communicated three pieces of information via flags:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Locations of nearby enemy muckrakers, in order to warn nearby slanderers to run away and nearby politicians to defend</li>
  <li>Locations and strength of enemy and neutral enlightenment centers, to signal for politicians and muckrakers to attack</li>
  <li>Edges of the map</li>
</ol><br>

<p>In Battlecode, all maps are symmetric under either vertical reflection, horizontal reflection, or 180-degree rotation.  As a result, given the location of a friendly enlightenment center, knowledge of the map edges implies that a second enlightenment center (which is likely enemy-owned) must be at one of three possible locations.  In the absence of spotting another enlightenment center directly, this indirect approach can be used to find a suitable target to attack.</p><br>

<p>Enlightenment centers, charged with the tasks of coordinating attacks (at least among the units they spawned) can read the flags of their units and relay information about enemy centers and map edges to their units.  In contrast, locations of enemy muckrakers is only intended for nearby units, so it can be relayed robot-to-robot to nearby clusters of politicians and slanderers.</p><br>

<h2><a name="navigation">Navigation and Bytecode Limitations</h2>
<p>Each tile on the map has a passability ranging from 0.1 to 1.  Performing any action while on a tile (including leaving the tile) incurs a cost inversely proportional to the passability.  This means that any (unoccupied) tile is in theory passable, some tiles slow units 10 times more than others.  When moving across the map, such tiles should be avoided if possible.</p><br>

<p>The simplest navigation algorithm is one that, given a destination tile, moves in the direction of that destination, ignoring passability costs.  On maps with varying passability, this will drastically slow units down.</p><br>

<p>An improvement is to use a local heuristic.  If the passability cost of moving straight toward a target is more than twice that of moving 45 degrees in either direction, then it's usually better to move 45 degrees away from the original target.</p><br>

<p>Ideally, we would like to find the optimal path all the way to the target, but this is impossible for targets outside our robot's vision radius.  In addition, robots have computational limitations that make it impossible even to process all the information they do have access to.  In Java, computational effort can be quantified in terms of bytecode, which corresponds to the fundamental operations of the Java virtual machine (e.g. adding two numbers, setting a variable).  The main units of the game (politicians and muckrakers) are limited to 15,000 bytecode.  While this sounds like a large number of operations, it can be consumed quickly if one explores paths inefficiently.  (Slanderers have smaller limits but only need to perform the simple task of fleeing muckrakers.)</p><br>

<p>One pathing algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm.</p><br> -->
